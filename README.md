# Notes: Please do not make any trading decisions based on this algorithm. This is simply a project created out of my passion for CS and my great interest in trading.
# 
# Project goals: When researching different trading strategies the fibonacci strategy that takes retracement levels into account really interested me. I thought it would be fun to try to put this into a program that could monitor one security and indicate the need to buy or sell based on the movement.
#
# What's in the repo: The cpp file that contains the algorithm that I wrote, and a short sample data file as an example of what kind of input this algorithm would take in (ticker, time, trend).
